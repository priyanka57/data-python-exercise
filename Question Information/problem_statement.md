The goal of this project is to create a small app using the same techniques you would normally use for a client.
When writing your application there are a few assumptions to keep in mind:

* Single machine will run the application not a cluster of computes.
* The machine will be somewhat limited in resources.
* When working with data no matter the size of the data in the exercise,
  assume it is too large to fit it all into memory.


Directions:

Write a python application that processes the two data files [students.csv , teachers.parquet]. The application should
use both files to output a report in json listing each student, the teacher the student has and the class ID the student is 
scheduled for.
