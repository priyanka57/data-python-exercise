The python application will take the two data files [students.csv , teachers.parquet] as input. The application uses both files to output a report in json listing each student, the teacher the student has and the class ID the student is scheduled for. 

This repo contains two folders:
1. Question statement and input folders
2. Solution provided with test files and virtual environment setup with instructions to follow. 

Thanks.
